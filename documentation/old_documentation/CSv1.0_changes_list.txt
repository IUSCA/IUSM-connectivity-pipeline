	Fixed a bug, where the wrong inputs were specified for the DWI intensity Outliers section.

	Probabilistic and deterministic tractography are now under separate flags.
	
	Under DWI parameters:
	There is no longer a order 0 threshold parameter. It was not necessary. Only order 2 and order 4 parameters remain.
	These are f-test thresholds to clasify a voxel as single (order 2) or two tensor (order 4).

	Batch is simplified with less hardcoded paths, StudyID variable specifying the prefix is no longer necessary and has been removed.
	
	Comments have been added, and blocks of code which should not be edited can be collapsed.
	
	HYDI_DTI and NODDI have been removed from the batch. I did this because I though Dr. Chen is going to process those data. They will remain included in version 0.9 and can be reinstated in future 		versions.

	The curve theshold for tractography has been changed to 45 degrees over 5 mm to match what I have need seeing done in the literature.
